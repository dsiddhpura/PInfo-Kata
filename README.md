# PInfo-Kata

Description:
- The objective is to find the path of lowest cost when moving across a grid. For this challenge, a grid of integers is provided where each integer represents the amount of cost encountered at a given point on the grid. A path enters the grid from the left (at any point) and passes through the grid to the right, moving only one column per round. Movement is always to the same row or an adjacent row, meaning the path can proceed horizontally or diagonally. Lets assume the first and last row are adjacent. Effectively, the grid “wraps”.

Solution:
- The best conceptual solution to be achieved by applying funcdamental concept of Graph theory and Shortest Path Algorithm.

Limitation:
- Currently this code is calibrated against single path search cycle.
